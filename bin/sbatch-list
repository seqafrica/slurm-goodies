  Slurm job array submission made easier.

  Submits a Slurm job array, passing each line from LISTFILE as the command
  line arguments to a parallel instance of SCRIPT.

  SBATCH_OPTS are passed as options to sbatch(1) and override any #SBATCH
  directives that may be set in SCRIPT.

  Lookup rules for SCRIPT are the same as for sbatch.  Notably: if SCRIPT
  has no directory path, then PWD is searched before PATH.

  Empty lines and comments in LISTFILE are ignored.  LISTFILE can be "-" to
  indicate standard input.  This enables for instance:
  
      ls -Q * | %s - my.job   # The -Q option quotes filenames

  NOTE: Lines from LISTFILE are interpreted by bash when passed to SCRIPT,
        hence the same quoting rules as for command-line arguments apply.

    exit ${1:-1}

# Do the work

# The way we implement this all is to generate an ephemeral script that we
# feed to sbatch on its stdin, in which we put:
#
#  - Any #SBATCH directives the user has put in SCRIPT
#  - A bash array that holds the contents of LISTFILE (yes, this may get big,
#    but since we may be reading it from stdin we need to keep it somewhere;
#    the unclean alternative would be a tempfile that we cannot clean up)
#  - Code to pick the appropriate line from that array for this task
#  - The call to SCRIPT with the argument line picked above
#
# Furthermore, we pass on to sbatch the SBATCH_OPTS from the command-line and
# (obviously, as this is what this was all about) the --array specification.

# Copy LISTFILE to temporary file, while shell-escaping every line
TMP_LIST="$(mktemp)"
grep -Ev '^[[:space:]]*(#|$)' "$LISTFILE" | while read -r LINE; do
    printf '%q\n' "$LINE"
done >"$TMP_LIST"

# Count the number of lines (= array size)
declare -ri N_LINES=$(fgrep -c '' "$TMP_LIST")

# Generate the batch job and pipe it into sbatch
{
  printf '#!/bin/bash
'
  # Copy the SBATCH directives from user's script
  grep -E '^#SBATCH ' "$EXE" 2>/dev/null || true

  # Generate the input array variable
  printf 'declare -a ARGS_LIST=(\n'
  cat "$TMP_LIST"; rm -f "$TMP_LIST"
  printf ')\n'

  # Generate the call
  printf 'exec bash -c "exec %s ${ARGS_LIST[$((SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID - 1))]}" %s\n' "$EXE" "${EXE##*/}"

} | # Pipe into sbatch with user options and add array spec
exec sbatch "${SBATCH_OPTS[@]}" --array 1-$N_LINES
